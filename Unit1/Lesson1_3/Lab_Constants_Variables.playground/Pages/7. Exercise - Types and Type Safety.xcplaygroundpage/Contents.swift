## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking the variable name.

var firstDecimal = 2.32
var secondDecimal = 3.45


//:  Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var trueOrFalse = true
print("No it does not compile because they are two different data types")

//:  Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
var num = 10
print("it does not compile because you cannot assign to different data types one is an int one is a double.")
